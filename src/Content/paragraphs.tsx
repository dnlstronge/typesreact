    as I am now using Typescript I wanted to make sure I could get jest set up to work using ts-jest. The compnents
    are simple and so are the tests. The increment counter I wanted to check that the dom element would display
    the expected corresponding value e.g plus or minus`,

    the element next to it and wrote simple tests to validate these actions. Nexr up I want to explore 
    testing functional components, mocking objects and more. `
